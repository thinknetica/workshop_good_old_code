It takes significant time and investment to tame this chaos. When you are a platform provider you are gathering tons of data from the developers using your platform. These developers building products on your platform need insight into that data to better understand how their application is performing or to troubleshoot it. Most Platforms or SaaS application providers find it both difficult and expensive to build customer-facing analytics and data applications into their platforms. In fact most companies don’t know what to do with the data they are gathering and continually postpone future product roadmap features aimed to unlock this data. This data can be a crucial part of the developer experience and can empower your customers. It can save you countless hours of handling support tickets, and increase overall stickiness on the platform.</p>

It is a project of OpenJDK that was proposed and led by <a href="https://www.azul.com/">Azul</a>. The CRaC Project defines public Java APIs that allow for the coordination of resources during checkpoint and restore operations. With CRaC, a checkpoint can be set at any point where an application can be safely paused. Azul is releasing a reference implementation of CRaC in JDK 17 with the Azul Zulu Build of OpenJDK for x86 64-bit Linux update. CRaC allows for an &#8220;instant&#8221; start at any point in the application lifecycle at an optimal speed. ​It also work&#8217;s really well with Azul&#8217;s ReadyNow! feature that optimizes warm-up. For the first time, developers will have a TCK-tested, CRaC-configured, production-ready JVM with commercial support available for their use.</p>

The software industry has seen rapid progress, the operating system that provides the foundation for our software applications is taken care of by companies like Google, Microsoft, and other players like Canonical, Amazon, etc. The robotics industry still needs that OS layer that handles the complexities so that engineers can build robots that serve their business needs. <a href="https://www.viam.com/">VIAM</a> aspires to be the Operating System for robotics that makes it easy to turn great ideas into production robots.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/eliothorowitz">Eliot Horowitz</a> is the Founder and CEO of VIAM and he joins us today. Eliot was previously the CTO at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, a database company. We discuss with him the different challenges one faces when trying to build a robot and how VIAM is trying to solve that.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It is common practice for non technical teams to provide bug reports that are missing vital information for developers to identify and quickly fix code, such as: network requests, console logs, HAR file, device information, video or screenshot replication, and more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Providing a comprehensive bug report requires logging into many tools and time spent context switching, creating an environment where people are less likely to report bugs, which is not an ideal scenario for any founder or builder.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Jam is a browser extension that will instantly replay a bug while automatically attaching diagnostics: network requests and speed, console logs, device, and more &#8211; all in one easy click. You don’t have to log into a new tool or disrupt workflows, as Jam has direct integrations with all the first class bug reporting tools to seamlessly drop diagnostics into a ticket.</p>

Nonetheless, the cloud has presented new hurdles for developers as it is intricate, and application development demands comprehension of cloud service intricacies. Moreover, creating portable applications across different cloud providers, as well as local testing and debugging, have proven to be difficult. Additionally, leaky abstractions and inadequate tooling have made it challenging to repurpose cloud architectures into reusable components.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, a cloud-centric programming language called Wing has been introduced. Wing enables developers to create distributed systems that fully capitalize on the cloud&#8217;s capabilities without the need to concern themselves with the underlying infrastructure.</p>

Nonetheless, the cloud has presented new hurdles for developers as it is intricate, and application development demands comprehension of cloud service intricacies. Moreover, creating portable applications across different cloud providers, as well as local testing and debugging, have proven to be difficult. Additionally, leaky abstractions and inadequate tooling have made it challenging to repurpose cloud architectures into reusable components.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, a cloud-centric programming language called Wing has been introduced. Wing enables developers to create distributed systems that fully capitalize on the cloud&#8217;s capabilities without the need to concern themselves with the underlying infrastructure.</p>

In doing so, Data Activation helps bring data people toward the center of the business, directly tying their work to business outcomes.</p>
<p><a href="https://hightouch.com/">Hightouch</a> is the simplest and fastest way to get started with Data Activation. As a Data Activation Platform, Hightouch uses Reverse ETL to sync data from the warehouse to 100+ different integrations. With Hightouch companies can leverage their existing data models and easily view and monitor all of their data syncs in a single platform. Better yet, Hightouch offers a visual audience builder that makes it easy for non-technical users to create custom audiences at moment&#8217;s notice.</p>

They provide scalability, fault tolerance, improved performance, and cost savings. By distributing data across nodes, they allow for efficient processing of large amounts of data and redundancy against failures. They can also be used to store data across multiple locations for faster access and better performance.</p>
<p>Turso is an edge-hosted, distributed database based on libSQL, an open-source and open-contribution fork of SQLite. It was designed to minimize query latency for applications where queries come from anywhere in the world. In particular, it works well with edge functions provided by cloud platforms such as CloudFlare, Netlify, and Vercel, by putting your data geographically close to the code that accesses it.</p>

The JVM is a powerful piece of software – this is the reason why Java has maintained its popularity over the past 26+ years. But… there are some ways that the JVM works that can impact the performance of your applications.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges is latency – how quickly can we respond to a request from a user to access your application. That comes down to garbage collection – which leads to pauses and a bad customer experience. Garbage collection pauses can vary. But they impact application performance. The bigger the heap, the longer your pauses&#8230;but how do you optimize? What about warm-up time? That’s also a big challenge. We’ve addressed these problems without re-writing code from scratch – and that leads to better Java performance without any code changes.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">API mocking is a technique used to simulate the behavior of an API without actually connecting to the real API. It is useful for various reasons, including testing, isolation, development, and cost reduction. By using API mocking, developers can test their code without relying on the availability of the real API, isolate the code being tested from the behavior of the API, work on their code even when the API is not yet available, and reduce the number of requests they make to the real API, thus saving money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

And they are becoming harder as we move more into the Cloud-native ecosystem. If we go back in time to the point where it was just a single monolith that you were building on your own. You&#8217;ll probably have a framework to manage the permissions for you. But when you are working with distributed microservices, especially if you are a polyglot, you can&#8217;t use those solutions anymore. So you end up having to sprinkle a bit of access control into every little microservice and component that you build. In addition, with the scale of modern applications, it&#8217;s no longer just your services, there are a lot of third-party services that you have to connect to. Think about things like authentication, billing, analytics and other stuff that you combine from eternal services into what you are building.</span></p>

Twitter has open sourced a lot of projects for others to use. Twitter created a fork of Memcached called Twemcache and also a fork of Redis to handle the caching issues. In this episode we talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/thinkingfish">Yao Yue</a>. Yao Yue is an expert in distributed systems and performance. She led the cache team at Twitter. Her most notable open-source project is Pelikan, a modular caching framework with the best performance and operator ergonomics in the domain of distributed caching. Pelikan is ideal for large scale deployment as well as cutting-edge research.</p>

The way you do that is you use the javac compiler and compile the source files down to the class files. Those class files can run on any system in interpreted mode. But those class files that are run in interpreted mode, they are not machine code specific. To get that code to run fast you need to turn that into optimized machine code and that’s what the JIT compiler does. The open JDK contains its JIT compiler called Hotspot.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

Connecting development services to production services is off limits. Test environments are limited to automated tests.<br />
Staging environments are woefully inadequate with the amount of data available for their use. Testing large and complex applications is becoming harder and harder. Speedscale provides developers a solution to this problem. <a href="https://speedscale.com/">Speedscale</a> assists in developing and testing applications by recreating real world traffic loads in test and development environments, essentially bringing the data quality of production into the exploratory world of development. <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewleray">Matthew LeRay</a> is the CTO and co-founder of Speedscale, and he&#8217;s our guest today.</p>

We search on the internet for some information. Many ask, why is that easy? And yet doing the same thing at my company is hard sometimes, not even possible. And when you do get the data, it&#8217;s unclear where it&#8217;s from or the degree you can trust it or use it. In a highly regulated firm, there&#8217;s even more pressure to select the best approved version of the information.</p>
<p>Enter the data catalog. Enterprise Data Catalogs are essential for searching for data in an organization. Moreover, their creation, maintenance, and design tap into the most fundamental theories of the philosophy of language and the nature of creating knowledge. Today we are interviewing architect and author Ole Olesen-Bagneux, who is finishing his first O&#8217;Reilly published book called Enterprise Data Catalogs. Today, he will explain what a data catalog is, the different ways computer scientists and information scientists think about searching for data versus searching in data, and how thinking about archiving data for a hundred years can help you create the best data catalog for your business today.</p>

It&#8217;s widely used to implement the secure socket layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS) protocols, which are the basis for secure, encrypted connections on the internet.<br />
On Oct 25th, the OpenSSL project informed its users of a critical vulnerability that affects the 3.0 and later versions of the OpenSSL component. In a twist to the usual formula, the project gave the world a week&#8217;s advance notice of the upcoming update, and various stakeholders prepared for this accordingly. In this episode, we sat down with <a href="https://twitter.com/llkkat">Ilkka Turunen</a>, <a href="https://www.sonatype.com/">Sonatype&#8217;s</a> Field CTO; we discussed a wide range of topics, including the OpenSSL vulnerability, Shodan, SBOMs, Software Supply Chain and others.<br />

And it didn&#8217;t take much time for Java to become the language for the enterprise. Consequently, most enterprises are still running legacy Java Monoliths on their infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breaking up a monolith is not an easy process–nor is it something that every company should do just because they have a monolith. In some cases, a monolith is just fine. But sometimes, you do need to decompose a monolith as the complexity of the monolith grows and leads to longer release cycles or scalability issues. Breaking down into microservices is a natural way to shift legacy applications to the cloud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://vfunction.com/">vFunction</a> is an artificial intelligence platform that assesses, analyzes, helps you design microservices and then automatically creates those microservices for you. So it&#8217;s an end-to-end platform from analysis to the actual creation of the code of those microservices with their respective APIs. While vFunction started with Java, they are expanding these capabilities to other platforms as well. <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/motir">Moti Rafalin</a> who is the CEO of vFunction and <a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/amirrapson">Amir Rapson</a> who is the CTO of vFunction join us today.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building and managing data-intensive applications has traditionally been costly and complex, and has placed an operational burden on developers to maintain as their organization scales. Todays’ developers, data scientists, and data engineers need a streamlined, single cloud data platform for building applications, pipelines, and machine learning models — without having to move or copy their data. Platforms like the<a href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/"> Snowflake Data Cloud</a> provides a unified tool for developers to easily build data applications with Python using Streamlit’s open source framework and Snowflake’s Native Application Framework, gain a streamlined architecture that natively supports users’ programming languages of choice including Java, Scala, SQL, and now Python with Snowpark, store and use transactional and analytical data together with Unistore, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/torstengrabs/">Torsten Grabs</a> is the Director of Product Management at Snowflake focused on Data Lake, Data Pipelines, and Data Science. He joins the show to dive into how Snowflake is disrupting application development, and how developers today can eliminate complexity with the Data Cloud.</p>

However, the ability to fabricate more and more transistors in a computer chip is approaching saturation as we are approaching atomic dimensions. Quantum Computing is a promising technology to take us beyond this. A quantum Computer uses qubits to run multi-dimensional quantum algorithms. Quantum Computers are faster and can solve problems that are beyond the reach of even the most  powerful classical supercomputers.<br />

</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dmitri Maslov is the Chief Software Architect at IBM’s Quantum Computing Division. He joins the show to discuss how Quantum Computing is different from Classical Computing. How to get started in this space, How would Quantum Computing impact current encryption standards, we also went through practical applications, quantum supremacy and quantum algorithms.</span></p>

Nevertheless, the process of building and operating  mission-critical ledgers to track and reconcile payments and money movement is complex. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twisp is rethinking core accounting and financial orchestration on a cloud-native ledger system, so developers can stop re-inventing the ledger and focus on building products their customer’s love. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you provision an instance of the Twisp accounting core, you get a transactions ledger for double-entry accounting, a chart of accounts to represent any economic activity, and layered balances for tracking settled, pending, and planned funds flows. All of this is accessible via a straightforward GraphQL API.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we speak with<a href="https://twitter.com/webriots?lang=en"> Jarred Ward</a>, Co-founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://www.twisp.com/">Twisp</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, Jarred was principal engineer at Simple, the first neobank, and later led the team building Open Platform at BBVA, one of the first banking-as-a-service products. </span></p>

Database tuning is a process in which the configurations of a database are modified to achieve optimal performance. Databases have hundreds of configuration knobs that control various factors, such as the amount of memory to use for caches or how often the data is written to the storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with these knobs is that</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are not standardized (i.e., two databases may have a different name for the same knob),</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not independent (i.e., changing one knob can impact others), </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">and not universal (i.e., what works for one application may be suboptimal for another). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, information about the effects of the knobs typically comes only from (expensive) experience.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ottertune.com/">OtterTune</a> is automatic database tuning software that promises to overcome these problems. It uses machine learning to tune the configuration knobs of your database automatically to improve performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, we interview<a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo?lang=en"> Andy Pavlo</a>. Andy is a Database Professor at Carnegie Mellon and Co-Founder of OtterTune.</span></p>

Securing these resources is a constant process for companies deploying new code to their cloud environments. It’s easy to overlook security flaws because company applications are very complex and many people work together to develop them. Wyze Labs, for example, had millions of users’ data stolen due to a mistake by a single employee.<br />
The company <a href="https://bridgecrew.io/">Bridgecrew</a> is a cloud security platform helping to prevent mistakes like that from happening. Bridgecrew integrates into developer workloads to automatically find infrastructure errors in cloud accounts, workloads, and infrastructure as code. Their platform also monitors code reviews and build pipelines to prevent errors from being deployed into production. If an error is found then Bridgecrew’s software reverts that code back to its last known correct state.<br />
In today’s episode we talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/guysenkot">Guy Eisenkot</a>, VP Product &amp; Co-founder at Bridgecrew. Guy previously worked as a<br />
Principal Product Manager at RSA Security and as a Product Manager at Fortscale before that. We discuss Infrastructure as code, devsecops, cloud security, software supply chain and composition analysis.</p>
